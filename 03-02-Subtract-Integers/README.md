In this exercise we are going to create integer variables, assign them values, and then learn how to subtract them and store the result in another integer variable.

First, initialize an integer variable named num1 and assign it the value 550.

Remember, first we indicate the data type (int), then comes the variable name, then we use the assignment operator (the = sign) and finally provide the value:
```
int num1 = 550;
```
Next, initialize another integer variable named num2 and assign it the value 70.

Then, initialize an integer variable named  answer to store the result of num1 minus num2.
```
int answer = num1 - num2;
```
Finally, display the answer variable in the console, using a `println` statement.
