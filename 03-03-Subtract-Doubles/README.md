In this exercise we are going to create double variables, assign them values, and then learn how to subtract them and store the result in another double variable.

First, initialize an double variable named num1 and assign it the value 876.5.

Remember, first we indicate the data type (double), then comes the variable name, then we use the assignment operator (the = sign) and finally provide the value:
```
double num1 = 876.5;
```
Next, initialize another double variable named num2 and assign it the value 80.8.

Then, initialize double variable named  answer to store the result of num1 minus num2.
```
double answer = num1 - num2;
```
Finally, display the answer variable in the console, using a print statement.
