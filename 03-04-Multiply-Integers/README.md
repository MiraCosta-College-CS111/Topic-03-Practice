In this exercise we are going to create integer variables, assign them values, and then learn how to multiply them together and store the result in another integer variable.

First, initialize an integer variable named num1 and assign it the value 2.

Remember, first we indicate the data type (int), then comes the variable name, then we use the assignment operator (the = sign) and finally provide the value:
```
int num1 = 2;
```
Next, initialize another integer variable named num2 and assign it the value 12.

Then, initialize integer variable named  answer to store the product of num1 and num2.
```
int answer = num1 * num2;
```
Finally, display the answer variable in the console, using a print statement.
